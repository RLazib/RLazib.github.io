WorldSoccerStats HTML/CSS/JS project

Made as a personal project to aggregate Football news, have an easy display of the tables of the top four leagues, a listing of all upcoming fixtures; as well as a way to practice and learn some web technologies.

Note: The API that I used has since been deprecated, so the league tables and fixtures currently don't work.
